 <p>Tttile: "Message From Nature."<br>
Written by: Kshma Lal.</p>
<p>The mountains tell me, hold your head high.
Whatever be the problem, look it in the eye.
The rivers tell me, don't look behind.
March on ahead, till your goal you find.
The sea tells me, have depth of character.
The waves call out, don't forget your laughter!
The trees tell me, do good to one and all.
Let go of the past, like I let my leaves fall.
The sun tells me, you must go on shining.
In every dark cloud, be the silver lining.
Have a look at nature, and you will see,
There's so much to learn, just like me!</p>

<p>tittle:Raising the Titanic<br>
By Robert Hedin</p>
<p>I spent the winter my father died down in the basement,
under the calm surface of the floorboards, hundreds
of little plastic parts spread out like debris
on the table. And for months while the snow fell
and my father sat in the big chair by the Philco, dying,
I worked my way up deck by deck, story by story,
from steerage to first class, until at last it was done,
stacks, deck chairs, all the delicate rigging.
And there it loomed, a blazing city of the dead.
Then painted the gaping hole at the waterline
and placed my father at the railings, my mother
in a lifeboat pulling away from the wreckage.
