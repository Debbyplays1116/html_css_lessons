 <h1>Poems and Fun fact</h1>   
 <h2>Poems</h2>
 <p>Tttile: "Message From Nature."<br>
Written by: Kshma Lal.</p>
<p>The mountains tell me, hold your head high.
Whatever be the problem, look it in the eye.
The rivers tell me, don't look behind.
March on ahead, till your goal you find.
The sea tells me, have depth of character.
The waves call out, don't forget your laughter!
The trees tell me, do good to one and all.
Let go of the past, like I let my leaves fall.
The sun tells me, you must go on shining.
In every dark cloud, be the silver lining.
Have a look at nature, and you will see,
There's so much to learn, just like me!</p>
